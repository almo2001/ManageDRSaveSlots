A tool to manage Deadzone: Rogue save slots
-------------------------------------------

Welcome to V0.9 of Almo's Deadzone: Rogue Save File Manager!
------------------------------------------------------------

As the game doesn't currently support multiple saves, I wrote this to allow players to keep several save slots with different progress for different groups of players they play with.

Note that this tool only updates its version of your save when you start it.

Platforms:
----------
Supports Windows only at this time.

Usage:
------

Installation:
	1. Just drop the .exe anywhere. It stores its data in the Windows AppData folder, it doesn't matter where it is.

Initialization:
	1. Start the program. It should find your save files automatically.
	2. Upon first startup, it copies your save into the Default slot.

Managing multiple saves:
	1. Use the Create option to make a new save.
	2. This copies the current save from the game into the slot.
	3. Use the Switch option to switch to the new slot.
	4. Close the tool.
	5. If you wish it to be a clean save from the very beginning of the game, now start the game and use the Reset Data option.
	6. Exit the game, and restart the tool.
	7. You now have your original save in the Default slot, and the new clean save in the newly created slot.
